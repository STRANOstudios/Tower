Modular Tower Defense is an engaging project aimed at providing players with a customizable and strategic gameplay experience. With various turret types, enemy challenges, and stackable buffs, players can defend their base against relentless waves of foes.

## Project Description

### Modular Tower Defense

Reference: [Sweet Rage](https://eventhorizonschool.itch.io/sweet-rage)

#### Features

- **Base Defense**
- **Enemies**: Move along a predefined path towards the base; upon contact, they damage it.
- **Turrets**: Three types of turrets, stackable.
- **Buffs**: Two buffs, stackable.

#### Loop
Players can select a turret or a buff and place them at predetermined points. If there is already a turret present at the point, it is stacked on top. The buff can be placed only if there is already at least one turret. The buff affects all turrets in the stack.

**Endless**: More enemies spawn with each wave.

## Installation Instructions

To copy from GitHub and build a Unity project without installing additional files, follow these general steps:

### Clone the Repository:

Open the GitHub repository page containing the Unity project.
Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" if you don't have Git installed, or use Git to clone the repository if you have it installed.
If you downloaded the ZIP file, extract its contents to a dedicated folder on your computer.
### Open Unity Hub:

Ensure you have Unity Hub installed on your machine. Unity Hub is a management tool for Unity projects.
Open Unity Hub and click on the "Add" button to add a new project.
### Select the Project:

Navigate to the folder where you extracted or cloned the Unity project.
Select the project folder and click "Open" or "Select Folder."
Install Unity Version (if needed):

If the Unity project requires a specific Unity version that you don't have installed, Unity Hub will prompt you to download and install the required version. Follow the prompts to install it.
### Open the Project:

Once the Unity version is installed, click on the project thumbnail in Unity Hub to open the project.
Resolve Dependencies (if needed):

Unity projects may have dependencies or plugins. Check the project documentation or readme for any specific instructions on resolving dependencies. You might need to import certain assets or packages from the Unity Asset Store.
### Build the Project:

Once the project is open, go to "File" -> "Build Settings."
Choose the target platform for your build (e.g., PC, Mac, Android, iOS).
Click on "Switch Platform" if necessary.
Click on "Build" to generate the executable or project files.
### Run the Project:

After building, you can run the project by executing the generated executable or running it directly from the Unity Editor.
These steps should allow you to copy a Unity project from GitHub, set it up in Unity Hub, and build it without needing to install additional files beyond Unity Hub and the required Unity version. Note that specific projects may have unique requirements, so always check the project documentation for any additional instructions.
